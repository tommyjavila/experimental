The following Docker info is from:
http://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/1499-installing-docker-on-ubuntu-14-04


NOTE: the following may need to be run with sudo if you are not running as root



===========================
Installing Docker on Ubuntu
===========================

$ apt-get install docker.io


After this command the docker process should be running. If not, start it:
$ service docker.io start


Create the following symlink:
$ ln -sf /usr/bin/docker.io  /usr/local/bin/docker





=====================================
Configure your Docker container
=====================================

Check if you have any docker images installed:
$ docker images


If not you can search what ubuntu images are available to download:
$ docker search ubuntu


Downoad a basic ubuntu 14.04 image:
$ docker pull ubuntu:14.04


We need to note the image ID so we can create a container


Now create the docker container:
$ docker run -i -t  <IMAGE_ID>  /bin/bash


You can run the docker ps command to get the container id
$ docker ps -a


To start the docker session, you can run:
$ docker start  <CONTAINER_ID>


$ docker attach <CONTAINER_ID>





=====================================
Configure Docker to run commands
=====================================

If you want to run another command besides /bin/bash you can do the following:

$ sudo docker start  <CONTAINER_ID>

$ sudo docker exec  <CONTAINER_ID>  <path to command>


In this case, it is assumed that we saved the new script in the container and that this script is executable.
For example, I saved a parent.sh script and its children scripts as /root/scripts.

I then ran:
$ sudo docker exec <CONTAINER_ID>  /root/scripts/parent.sh
